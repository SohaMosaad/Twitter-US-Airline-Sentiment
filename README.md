Natural Language Processing

## Data Description:

A sentiment analysis job about the problems of each major U.S. airline. Twitter data was scraped from February of 2015 and contributors were asked to first classify positive, negative, and neutral tweets, followed by categorizing negative reasons (such as "late flight" or "rude service").

 

## Dataset:

The dataset has the following columns:

- tweet_id
